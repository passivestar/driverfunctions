# Driver Functions

This addon adds some useful functions that can be used in Blender driver expressions. Useful for simple quick animations (rotations that loop, oscillations, repeating the same animation for multiple objects with some time offset, etc.). Some functions require `Use Self` to be enabled on animated objects.
